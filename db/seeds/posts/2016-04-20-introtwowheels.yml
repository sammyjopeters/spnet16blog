  <p>Have you ever mentioned something in passing to someone in conversation on a particular topic, only to watch their face light up? </p>

  <p>Have you watched this person delve into a huge speech about why this topic is amazing, elaborating on small, insignificant details that make no sense to you?
  Yeah, that’s me about motorcycling.</p>

  <p>The amusing part of all this is that until about 2010, I’d never given a second glance to motorcycles; I was deeply obsessed with the V8 Supercars class of motorsport (and in many ways I’m still deeply in love with Holden machines!)
  It was my current partner, clever and conniving - who gave me what I call “the pinprick” - a taste that ignited a curiosity for more. </p>

  <p>This pin-prick wasn’t overly complicated - it was a single ride we took together, from the north shore to my university in Kensington - a ride of about 35 minutes. We flew over a couple of bridges with some amazing views to the city, before weaving in and out of the awful traffic around the inner west suburbs. By the time I hopped off the bike, my head was whirring and I felt utterly invigorated. My partner didn’t say anything but merely smiled at me knowingly - an expression he wore subsequently when I asked to get on the back again… and again.</p>

  <p>Eventually, I got tired of riding on the passenger seat and wanted one of my own - and the rest as they say, is history. (History I’m sure I’ll elaborate in further blog posts… <em>wink</em>)</p>

  <p>There’s something special about the world of Motorcycling. It could be the instant family you acquire, willing to give advice and recommendations at the drop of a hat. It could be the instant street cred you obtain with the ability to rock up to something on this loud, thrumming machine. </p>

  <p>Or it could be the wind in your hair, the smells of the street and the sounds of your motorcycle on every ride you take. </p>

  <p>Whatever it is, I’m hooked. And I’ll elaborate about it all at length, in due course.</p>
